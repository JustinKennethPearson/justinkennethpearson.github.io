It is much harder for a
non-native speaker. The only way to get better at writing is by
practising<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. I try to get my students to write early and often. The
worse thing that can happen is that you never use some text you
wrote. It is better to write first, and then decide what you are going
to use.</p><p>I find writing a useful way of helping me think. By trying to write
down an idea precisely, you often find that you have not thought
through your idea properly. This applies to mathematics as well. Often
when trying to prove something, there are lots of easy details that
you do not bother with. You assume that you fill in the easy details
later. You should try to sort out the easy details early to avoid
discovering later that the foundations to your proof are made of
sand.</p><p>Here are various links that over the years I have found interesting
and useful.</p><ul><li><p>Our research group has a collection of
<a href=http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/optimisation/education>links</a>
for students on writing. In particular, we have a <a href=http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/optimisation/checkList.pdf>style
guide</a>. Even
if you do not follow the style guide, I would recommend that you
read it.</p></li><li><p>My current favourite style guide is <a href=https://stevenpinker.com/>Steven
Pinker's</a> book <a href=https://stevenpinker.com/publications/sense-style-thinking-persons-guide-writing-21st-century>The Sense of Style: The
Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st
Century</a>. Steven
Pinker is a linguist. Linguists will tell you that grammar should be
descriptive and not prescriptive. Even if this is true, then it does
not give you a license to write whatever you want and ignore the
grammar you learnt at school. If you are writing technical or
scientific texts, then your aim should not be to change language, but
instead to write clearly so that the reader understands what you are
saying. Pinker has some interesting ideas about how to think about
writing and grammar. One idea is to think about how your sentence is
parsed, and what its parse tree looks like. You should aim to write
sentences that are easy to parse. Another idea is that different
audiences have different expectations about what is correct. So even
if you believe that there is no absolute correct grammar, the rules
describe what expectations your audience has.<br>Leave the task of changing language to poets and novelists.</p></li><li><p>If you want an opinionated but thorough guide to grammar, then try
