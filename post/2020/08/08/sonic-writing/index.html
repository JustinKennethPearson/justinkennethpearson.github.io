is a fascinating book by <a href=http://www.ixi-audio.net/thor/>Thor
Magnusson</a>, who describes
<a href=https://thormagnusson.github.io/>himself</a> as:</p><blockquote><p>A worker in rhythm, frequencies and intensities. Research and
development in the areas of music and technology.</p></blockquote><p>Magnusson is an
<a href=https://profiles.sussex.ac.uk/p164902-thor-magnusson>academic</a>, a
musician and has written lots of
<a href=http://www.ixi-audio.net/content/software.html>software</a> in and
around electronic music. He has also written a good introduction,
<a href=https://leanpub.com/ScoringSound>Scoring Sound</a>, to programming with

Writing</a>
is an attempt to make sense of new media, new opportunities, and new
types of musical compositions that is afforded by new technologies for
electronic music. It includes a whirlwind tour of musical history
using ideas from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_culture>material
culture</a> to understand
how musical instruments and musical scores have been affected by
musical practice, and how musical practice affects musical
instruments. The historical survey is then used to help us understand
new types of musical instruments for electronic music.</p><p>There is an interesting discussion of new organological
classifications of digital instruments based on his paper <a href=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09298215.2017.1353636>Musical
Organics: A Heterarchical Approach to Digital
Organology</a>.
The term <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organology>Organology</a> was
new to me, but it is the study of different musical instrument types.</p><p>Along the way, questions are discussed such as: what actually is a
music work?. Some of the discussion on the concept of a musical work
borrows form <a href=https://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/lydia-goehr>Lydia
Goehr</a>'s
very interesting book <a href=https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198235410.001.0001/acprof-9780198235415>The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay
in the Philosophy of
Music</a>.
It can be argued that the idea of a musical work historically is bound
up with the idea printing and publication. Before the mass production
of musical scores, composers and musicians just got on with making
music. With the advent of the printing press, composers became more
interesting in becoming an author. Some of the possibilities of
collaboration offered by current technology allows us, if we want to,
to break the romantic mould of the composer handing down a composition
that is to be performed to a passive audience.</p><p>The book makes many interesting points about the modern computer music
landscape: the idea of code as a musical score, live coding as an
art form, and the use of AI in music. The idea of code as a musical
score, might be an obvious idea for a computer scientist, but
Magnusson argues that this should be taken seriously
musicologists. There are many pointers to lots of current
projects. One particularly interesting open project is Google's
<a href=https://magenta.tensorflow.org/>Maganta</a> project that uses
<a href=https://www.tensorflow.org/>TensorFlow</a> for various musical
applications.</p><p>The book is worth reading just for the references alone. I found
myself constantly googling and getting side tracked down interesting
avenues. Be sure to check out the <a href=http://www.sonicwriting.org/>Research
blog</a> that is associated with the book
and the research project that created the book.</p></div></article></main><footer id=footer class="mt-auto mb-2"><section class="container text-end">Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a> using the
